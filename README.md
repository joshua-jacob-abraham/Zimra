# Zimra - Customizable Wish Cards  

Send your loved ones custom name added cards on any occasion! Thats what Zimra is. 
Zimra is meant to be an all-occasion wish card generator. The initial version supports only Valentineâ€™s Day, but Iâ€™ll be adding more occasions when I get the time! It uses URL parameters to personalize the card with names. Feel free to contribute and add more occasion cards too!
